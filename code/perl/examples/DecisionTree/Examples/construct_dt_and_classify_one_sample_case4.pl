##  This example script is for purely nemeric features generated by the
##  TrainingDataGeneratorNumeric class using the information in the parameter file
##  param_numeric.txt The training data was generated by script
##  generate_training_data_numeric.pl

##  Now how we tell the module that the class labels are placed in column indexed 1
##  and that the features are in columns indexed 2 and 3 of the csv file.

##  Remember that column indexing of the csv file is zero-based.
